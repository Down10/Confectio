Confectio Dark is a dark syntax theme for [Atom][atom], a nice treat for being a very good text editor.

It features primary colors on a dark background, based on [Atom One Dark][atom-one-dark] and inspired by syntax themes [Fizzy][fizzy] and [IR_White][irw] for TextMate, and the [Soda Theme][soda] for SublimeText.

Note that this is only a syntax theme, and will not affect the Atom UI (it works with both the Light and Dark UI schemes).

See [release notes](https://github.com/Down10/confectio-dark-syntax/releases).


## About the name

_Confectio_ is a Latin declination for _composing_. In a happy coincidence, a “confection” can refer to both a composition (written code) and a confectionery (sweet dessert).
