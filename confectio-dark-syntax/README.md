# Confectio Dark

Confectio Dark is a dark syntax theme for [Atom](http://atom.io/), a nice treat for being a very good IDE.

It features bright, primary colors on a dark background, based on Atom One Dark and inspired by syntax themes [Fizzy][fizzy] and [IR_White][irw] for TextMate, and the [Soda Theme][soda] for SublimeText.

Note that this is only a syntax theme, and will not affect the Atom UI (it works with both the Light and Dark UI schemes).

### Installation

This theme can be activated by going to the __Themes__ section in the Settings view (`Command-,`) and selecting “Confectio” from the __Syntax Themes__ dropdown menu.


### About the name

_Confectio_ is a Latin declination for _composing_. In a happy coincidence, a “confection” can refer to both a composition (written code) and a sweet dessert (confectionery).
